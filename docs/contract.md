# Ask tool contract

`ask_user` is a pi-native clarification tool for cases where implementation depends on user preference or missing requirements.

This document defines the stable external behavior. It does not explain internal helper-by-helper implementation.

## Input

```ts
{
  title?: string;
  questions: Array<{
    id: string;
    label?: string;
    prompt: string;
    type?: "single" | "multi" | "preview";
    required?: boolean;
    options: Array<{
      value: string;
      label: string;
      description?: string;
      preview?: string;
    }>;
  }>;
}
```

## Input rules

- at least one question is required
- every question must have non-empty trimmed `id` and `prompt`
- every question must have at least one option
- question ids must be unique within one tool call
- option `value`s must be unique within a question
- optional `label`, `description`, and `preview` fields must not be blank when provided
- `label` falls back to `Q1`, `Q2`, ...
- `type` defaults to `single`
- `required` defaults to `false`
- `required` is metadata only; it never blocks submission
- preview questions require preview text for every declared option; option descriptions do not satisfy this requirement, and invalid preview payloads report a fix hint to add preview text or switch to `type: "single"`
- all questions get an internal `Type your own` option

## Output

            note: string;
          }
      >;

}
```

## Output rules

- `cancelled: true` means the user dismissed the flow, UI was unavailable, or the payload was invalid before UI opened
- invalid payloads return `error.kind === "invalid_input"` with structured `issues` and a transcript-friendly `Invalid ask_user payload:` message
- `mode: "submit"` is normal completion; `mode: "elaborate"` means the user asked the agent to continue with follow-up clarification based on notes
- unanswered questions are omitted from `answers`
- in `mode: "elaborate"`, `answers` contains only committed answers; note-only entries move to `elaboration.items`
- `continuation.strategy === "refine_only"` means the next ask should refine the current flow rather than restart it
- `continuation.preservedAnswers` contains previously committed answers that should be kept as context and not re-asked
- `continuation.affectedQuestionIds` lists the only questions that should be revisited
- `continuation.questionStates` marks each question as `answered`, `needs_clarification`, or `unanswered`
- single-select answers still use arrays
- `indices` are 1-based rendered option positions
- `customText` stores the free-form answer
- on single-select questions, saving free-form text clears selected options for that question
- on multi-select questions, `values` and `labels` include both selected options and `customText` when both are present
- on multi-select questions, selected options keep their original order and `customText` is appended last
- saving or clearing free-form text on a multi-select question does not clear other selected options
- `note` stores a question-level note
- `optionNotes` includes only notes for selected options
- question notes may exist without a selected answer
- `elaboration.items` includes all question notes and all option notes, even for unselected options
- every elaboration item includes the full normalized question and option list for that question so referential notes like `above` remain understandable to the agent
- option-targeted elaboration items include the specific noted option plus whether it is currently selected
- question-targeted elaboration items include whether the question already has a committed answer
- `elaboration.instruction` tells the agent to answer the clarification directly first, then re-ask only the affected questions if a choice is still needed
- after clarification, agents should prefer another structured follow-up over plain-text multiple choice when a decision is still unresolved
- once prior answers narrow the branch, agents should bundle the next 2-3 related unresolved questions into one follow-up ask when possible, instead of using a long sequence of single-question asks
- `elaboration` is only present when `mode === "elaborate"`
- elaborate `content` text and transcript rendering describe each note directly using the full question prompt and option label, instead of a generic elaboration banner

## Supported UX

- tabbed multi-question flow
- single-select, multi-select, and preview questions
- inline free-form answers for all question types
- pi-style `@` file path autocomplete inside free-form answer and note editors
- question notes via `Shift+N`
- option notes via `n`
- number-key quick selection
- submit/elaborate/cancel review tab
- on the review tab, `Submit` and `Cancel` preview notes only for answered questions
- on the review tab, `Elaborate` preview expands to all question notes and all option notes, including notes on unselected options
- transcript-friendly call and result rendering
- elaborate results are phrased as direct follow-up instructions, for example: `User asked to elaborate on question "Which option would you like to select?" option "Option A" with note "why this one?"`

## Keyboard behavior

Main flow:

- `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Left`, `Right`: move between tabs
- `Up`, `Down`: move between options
- `Enter`: confirm or submit
- `Esc`: cancel the flow
- `Ctrl+C`: dismiss the entire flow immediately, even while editing a note or free-form answer
- `1..9`: select or toggle the matching option; on the review tab, `1`, `2`, and `3` trigger `Submit`, `Elaborate`, and `Cancel`
- `Space`: toggle the active option
- `n`: edit the active option note
- `Shift+N`: edit the current question note

Editing flow:

- `Enter`: save and submit the current input
- `Esc`: save draft and close the editor
- `Ctrl+C`: dismiss the entire flow immediately without saving the current editor draft
- when editor has text, arrow keys and `Tab` stay in the editor so the cursor can move while typing
- when editor is empty, `Up`/`Down` move options and `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`/`Left`/`Right` move between tabs without requiring `Esc` first
- navigation resumes only after closing the editor with `Esc`, unless the editor is empty and the navigation keys above are used

## Non-interactive mode

If `ctx.hasUI === false`, the tool returns a `Needs user input` message in `content` and a cancelled result in `details`.

Validation is handled inside the tool so malformed calls produce the same structured error shape as other invalid payloads instead of relying on pre-execution schema failures.

The fallback message includes normalized pending questions and options so the caller can re-ask them manually. `details.questions` still contains normalized question metadata, while `details.answers` stays empty until a user responds.

## Skill alignment (advisory)

The auto-bundled skill profile at `skills/ask-user/SKILL.md` defines agent-side decision-gate guidance for when to call `ask_user`. It is enabled by default when the package is installed, but can be disabled via `pi config`.

It is advisory only. If there is any conflict, contract + tests win.

## Source of truth

Behavior should be verified against:

1. `src/types.ts` and exported state/result helpers
2. `tests/*.test.ts`
3. this contract
