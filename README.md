It lets an agent pause, ask structured questions in a terminal UI, and continue with normalized answers instead of guessing.

## Use

After installation, the extension registers the `ask_user` tool.

Agents can auto-discover and call it when they need clarification instead of guessing. In interactive sessions, it opens a terminal UI flow for structured answers, supports native pi-style `@` file references while typing answers or notes, and returns normalized answers back to the agent.

This package also bundles the `ask-user` skill profile from `skills/ask-user/SKILL.md`. It reinforces when to use the tool, is enabled by default when installed, and can be disabled via `pi config`. The skill was inspired by https://github.com/edlsh/pi-ask-user.

You can still add your own agent instruction if you want to further reinforce usage.

For exact input/output and UX guarantees, see [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md).

## Local development

### Run locally in pi

```bash
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```

### Run in isolated test mode (extension + bundled skill only)

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm dev ../test
```

`pnpm dev [path]` runs pi with `--no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-themes --no-context-files`, loads this repo’s extension and `skills/ask-user`, and starts pi from `[path]` by changing directories before launch (defaults to `.`).

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Install git hooks (contributors)

`lefthook` is not installed automatically. If you want the local commit hooks used by this repo, run:

```bash
pnpm exec lefthook install
```

### Development commands

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm lint
pnpm check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

### Commit workflow

This repo uses `lefthook`, Commitizen, conventional commitlint, and semantic-release.

If you want local hooks, install them once after `pnpm install`:

```bash
pnpm exec lefthook install
```

Recommended flow:

```bash
pnpm commit
```

- `src/` — TypeScript extension implementation
- `tests/` — behavior-focused tests
- `docs/` — small docs set for contract and architecture
- `docs/media/` — repository-only README media assets

## Documentation

Docs stay intentionally small:

- `docs/README.md` — index
- `docs/contract.md` — external behavior
- `docs/architecture.md` — module boundaries and invariants
